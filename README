Written by Michael Patterson in the fall of 2009.
First project in Computer Science 229 at Iowa State University.
I recieved a 1900/1900 on it.

This project can be made simply by typing "make".
All the files are in this directory and all the java files are in the default
package.  The c files needed for the jni are compiled into the "fourier_lib.so"
file.  This should be loaded dynamically, so there is no need to change any file
paths.

In the makefile I link to the correct Java libraries for the jni.  They work for
both my pc and pyrite, but I've also included the normal path in the comment in
case something goes wrong.  I've tested the Makefile on pyrite so it 
should work fine.

One issue I ran into was that java doesn't have any unsigned int data type.  The
best solution I could come up with was to cast to doubles, and then if the value
is negative, I add 2 times Max_Int_Value to it to get it back to the right value.

Also, after testing the dtmf program, I made some changes from the dtmf 
description in the assignment sheet.  I got much more reliable results when
I compared the frequency component to 2.5x the value 3.5% away rather than 5x.
I also check that the component is > 500.  I've tested this and it's been 
properly picking up button presses that meet the specs given in the assignment.
